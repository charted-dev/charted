# - Windows: C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Noelware\charted\hoshi\data.db
# - macOS:  /Users/{user}/Library/Application Support/Noelware/charted/hoshi/data.db
# - Linux:
#     - uid 0: /root/.local/share/Noelware/charted/hoshi/data.db
#     - rootless: /home/{user}/.local/share/Noelware/charted/hoshi/data.db

# You can override the setting with `instance.dbpath` below.

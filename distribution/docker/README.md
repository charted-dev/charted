# 🐻‍❄️🐳 charted-server :: Docker Images

This is the canonical source root for charted-server's Docker Images. The images support Docker Engine >=20.10 and use the Ubuntu distribution
by default, but Alpine images are also available (suffixed with `-alpine`).

The images are hosted on [Noelware's Container Registry](https://cr.noelware.cloud) and on the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/charted-dev/packages). We publish
on GitHub's container registry as a safe alternative if Noelware's container registry ever fails due to maintenance or any other sort of reason.

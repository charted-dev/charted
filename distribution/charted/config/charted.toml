# | This is the TOML configuration reference for `charted-server` by Noelware, LLC.    |
# | To load a custom configuration file, you can either:                               |
# |                                                                                    |
# |  - Place a `config.toml` in the root directory where you invoke `charted server`   |
# |                                                                                    |
# |  - As a environment variable named `CHARTED_CONFIG_FILE` set to a relative         |
# |    or an absolute path like `./hello.toml`, `/root/hello.toml`. The process        |
# |    just needs to read the contents of the file.                                    |
# |                                                                                    |
# |  - Have a `config/` directory with either a `config.toml` or `charted.toml` file   |
# |    with the properly formatted properties.                                         |
# |                                                                                    |

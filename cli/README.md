# charted-server CLI
This is the CLI built in Rust (~~because I was bullied into it ([proof](https://noel-is.gay/images/ef4ea67a.png))~~), I mean... because why not!

This project is meant to be a lightweight version of the [old server runner](https://github.com/charted-dev/charted/blob/ab9f54fa9a57fadfd999699d1435ea9330ac0cf6/server/bin/charted-server) but with more functionality and maybe a bit faster? Also, a easier way to make it cross-platform.

## How to build?
```shell
$ cd cli
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/charted
```

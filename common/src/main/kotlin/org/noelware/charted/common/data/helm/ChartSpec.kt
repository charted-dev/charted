     * ## charted-server Annotations
     * - `noelware.org/charted/has-security-updates`: Use this annotation to determine if this chart release contains
     *                                                a security update or not. This will be automatically populated via the
     *                                                `has_security_update` property in a repository release.
     * - `noelware.org/charted/changelog`:            Use this annotation to link to a changelog file. The Helm plugin for charted
     *                                                will automatically pull the changelog file via the `${file("...")}` key, or you
     *                                                can embed the changelog here.
     * - `noelware.org/charted/license`:              Valid SPDX identifier that this chart is released from. Use the `noelware.org/charted/license-url`
     *                                                annotation to link to the license file. It will use the SPDX License URL if the annotation was not found.
     * - `noelware.org/charted/operator-images`:      A list of operator images if the `noelware.org/charted/is-operator` annotation is present.
     *                                                You can use commas to separate the images if you wish.
     * - `noelware.org/charted/links`:                This annotation will allow you to embed other links from sources
     *
     * ## Artifact Hub Annotations supported by charted-server
     * - `artifacthub.io/changes`:                 This annotation is used to provide some details about the changes introduced by a given chart version.
     *                                             Artifact Hub can generate and display a ChangeLog based on the entries in the changes
     *                                             field in all your chart versions.\nThis annotation can be provided using two different formats:
     *                                               - using a plain list of strings with the description of the change
     *                                               - using a list of objects with some extra structured information (see example below).
     *                                             Please feel free to use the one that better suits your needs. The UI experience will be slightly
     *                                             different depending on the choice. When using the list of objects option the valid supported kinds
     *                                             are added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed and security.
     * - `artifacthub.io/containsSecurityUpdates`: Use this annotation to indicate that this chart version contains security
     *                                             updates. When a package release contains security updates, a special message
     *                                             will be displayed in the Artifact Hub UI as well as in the new release email
     *                                             notification.
     * - `artifacthub.io/images`:                  This annotation can be used to list the operatorâ€™s CRDs. They will be visible in the packageâ€™s detail view as cards.
     * - `artifacthub.io/license`:                 (deprecated) Use this annotation to indicate the chartâ€™s license. By default,
     *                                             Artifact Hub tries to read the chartâ€™s license from the LICENSE file in the
     *                                             chart, but itâ€™s possible to override or provide it with this annotation.
     *                                             It must be a valid SPDX identifier. | Please use the `noelware.org/charted/license` annotation
     *                                             instead.
     * - `artifacthub.io/links`:                   This annotation allows including named links, which will be rendered nicely
     *                                             in charted. You can use this annotation to include links not included
     *                                             previously in the Chart.yaml file, or you can use it to name links already
     *                                             present (in the sources section, for example).

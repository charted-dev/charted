 *
 * ```yaml
 * debug: true
 * ```
 *
 * or, you can use a system property with the `-Dorg.noelware.charted.debug.mode` set to `yes`, `true`,
 * `1`, or `si` and debug mode would be enabled:
 *
 * ```sh
 * CHARTED_JAVA_OPTS="-Dorg.noelware.charted.debug.mode=yes" ./bin/charted-server

 *
 * You can also set `CHARTED_DEBUG` to `true` to get the same result.

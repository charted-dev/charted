 * be `true` if [Sentry.init] was called and the [coroutine context][HazelScope.coroutineContext] of the Hazel coroutine
 * scope.
 *
 * Read the documentation on [CoroutineScope.launch] for more information on how this works.
 * @param start The coroutine start option, the default will be [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].

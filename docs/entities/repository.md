# Repository

A **repository** is a simple "Helm chart" created by a [User](https://charts.noelware.org/docs/server/entities/user) or an [Organization](https://charts.noelware.org/docs/server/entities/organization) in which it can be **private** or **public**.

You would generally use the [Parcel](https://charts.noelware.org/docs/cli) CLI utility to pull and push data to **charted-server** since Helm has no way to grabbing the Helm chart since it is private by the repository owners. You can use the `helm` CLI tool if the package is public.

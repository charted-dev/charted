**charted-server** is a free and open platform to host, test, and build Helm charts that allows you to use Helm efficiently with a pretty
web interface with [Hoshi](https://github.com/charted-dev/hoshi), or to scale Helm charts easily without worrying if it will be packaged
efficiently and securely.

**charted-server** is also the first product released by [Noelware, LLC.](https://noelware.org). We use this same repository to host
[our official instance](https://charts.noelware.org)!

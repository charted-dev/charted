/// ```toml file=config/charted.toml
/// [server.ratelimits]
/// # defines how many requests authorized users can make in the span
/// # of `config.server.ratelimits.ttl` until they get a 429 error.
/// max_requests_for_authorized_users = 100
///
/// # same aspect as `max_requests_for_authorized_users`, but for non-authorized
/// # users (which it'll be ratelimited by IP address)
/// max_requests_for_unauthorized_users = 10
///
/// # time-to-live duration on how long ratelimits should expire.
/// ttl = "30m"

/// [server.ratelimits.caching]

# 🐻‍❄️💌 Emails Microservice
> *charted's email service built in Rust that can be connected via gRPC*

**email-service** is a small microservice to help transfer emails towards other people without trying to implement it in different languages. This is used in [charted-server](https://github.com/charted-dev/charted) for member invitations, passwordless authentication, and more.

# Updates/Fixes

-   A bunch of dependency updates by @renovate-bot

# Removed

-   Cassandra has been swapped with ClickHouse due to Noelware's infrastructure conflicts. ([@auguwu](https://github.com/auguwu))

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/charted-dev/charted/compare/v0.2.0-nightly.1...v0.3-nightly

# v0.2.0-nightly.1

This release fixes some issues with our Release (Nightly) pipeline for the Docker images.

# v0.2.0-nightly

This release comes with a few changes and dependency upgrades. v0.3-nightly should contain actual features like repository and organization member support and the web UI.

## Additions

-   OpenAPI support is available on the server, which you can access from `<server url>/openapi.json` or `<server url>/openapi.yaml`. Documentation for **charted-server** will be relied on the official instance for API routing and official SDKs for **charted-server** will exist around October to November 2022.
-   Elastic APM tracing is supported, but it is very limiting. We do plan to support anything that supports the OpenTelemetry API.
-   Images for the Cassandra database should be available from the `ghcr.io/charted-dev/charted/migrations` image, not sure!
-   Generating instance UUIDs for Noelware Analytics can be disabled with the `CHARTED_NO_ANALYTICS` environment variable.
-   Docker image will use JDK 19 instead of JDK 18 (thanks #122 by @renovate-bot)

## Dependency Updates

-   Upgrade **io.insert-koin:koin-core** from v3.2.0 to v3.2.1 by @renovate-bot in #89

-   Upgrade **com.google.protobuf:protoc** dependency from 3.21.5 to 3.21.7 by @renovate-bot in #64

(this is not all the dependency updates, check the changelog below to go through all of them)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/charted-dev/charted/compare/1.1.1-nightly...1.2.0-nightly

# v1.1.1-nightly

The Docker image now makes the **charted-server** binary executable, which is the only change in this release.

# v1.1.0-nightly

Many fixes with Logback and the Docker image not properly running... sorry for taking a while, Logback was not wanting to work until me being
sleepy at 8am trying to fix the problem, which I did, so please be proud of me.

# v1.0.0-nightly

This is the first alpha release of **charted-server**. At the moment, we only distribute the tarballs and ZIP files in this release,
and Docker images that are available on the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/charted-dev/charted/pkgs/container/charted).
